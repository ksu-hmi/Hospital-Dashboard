# Hospital Evaluation Metrics - Dashboard

This purpose of this dashboard is to accumulate data published by CMS and other hospital monitoring organizations and display that information in a graphical dashboard.  Metrics that will be explored will be:
        1. Readmissions
        2. Hospital acquired infections
        3. IPPS Charges per discharge for top 100 DRGs
        4. Other national data statistics
  
  As doctors and hospitals are required to publish pricing, these analytics will encompass that data as well as provide data on the safety   and keu performance indicators.
        
        
## Python libraries to explore:
    pandas - to extract and format the data for the graphics
    ployly - data visualization
