# Hospital Evaluation Metrics - Dashboard

This purpose of this dashboard is to accumulate data published by CMS and other hospital monitoring organizations and display that information in a graphical dashboard.  Metrics that will be explored will be:
        1. Readmissions
        2. Hospital acquired infections
        3. IPPS Charges per discharge for top 100 DRGs
        4. Other national data statistics
 The user will be able to select a hospital by zip code then metrics for that hospital will be graphically displayed as compared to the national average.
  
## Python libraries to explore:
    pandas - to extract and format the data for the graphics
    plotly - data visualization
    matplotlib
    flask   - publication/viewing of graphics
