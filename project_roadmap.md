- [x] Define initial project paramaters and document in the README file
- [x] Search github and other datasources for code to query the Medicare dataset to determine if the data in those queries retrieves the necessary data for the defined project; Can this code be modified to meet stated goals?
- [x] Research python libraries needed to create a dashboard using a csv file</li>
- [x] Find tutorials on using pandas
- [x] Watch Chapter 1 of Datacamp tutorial - "Pandas: Data Frames"  https.//www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python
