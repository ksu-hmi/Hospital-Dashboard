## Project Roadmap_Hospital Dashboard Project ##
<ol>
<li>DONE Join ks-hmi organization on Github</li>
<li>DONE Set up repostiory for selected project on github</li>
<li>DONE Review tutorial for github desktop</li>
<li>DONE nstall github desktop</li>
<li>DONE Research availalble datasets to create a dashboard on hospital safety and quality. Determine if datasets will need to be cleaned; what is required to download the data?</li>
  <li>DONE Define initial project paramaters and document in the README file
<li>DONE Search github and other datasources for code to query the Medicare dataset to determine if the data in those queries retrieves the necessary data for the defined project; Can this code be modified to meet stated goals?
<li>DONE Research python libraries needed to create a dashboard using a csv file</li>
<li>DONE Find tutorials on using pandas</li>
<li>DONE Watch Chapter 1 of Datacamp tutorial - "Pandas: Data Frames"  https.//www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python</li>
<li>DONE Download Medicare datasets from cms.gov</li>https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook
  <li>DONE Fork the respository for pandas code for various scenarios:https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook</li>
  <li>DONE Fork the repository https://github.com/bkovales1/query-for-hospital/blob/master/Coding_exercise.py to test code for query/user interface</li?
  <li>Review datasets to determine which data is needed from the downloaded data and if it will need to be modified prior to or during import
  <li>Write and test code to import datasets that have been downloaded</li>
  <li>Review and select one of the following plotting tools in python and determine best tool to achieve goal of project: matploblib or plotly</li>
  <li>Search github for code to display barcharts and/or line graphs for selected dashboard tool</li>
  <li>Search github for code to make dashboards interactive</li>
  <li>Test selected plotting tools</li>
  <li>Reserach best platform for presentation - can flask or heroku be used to present the results?</li>
  <li>Use local host to present if insufficient time to develop a web app</li>
  <li>Write documentation for final project</li>
  <li>Use documentation to create short presentation about the project</li>
